created an hx-swap-oob endpoint to remove jobs, which is sick
now I want to use to implement job removal by websocket

Removed this from img reset tag
    hx-get="serialize/drop-job/{{ row.job_number }}" 
    this was actually awesome, I want to make all requests like this via websockets
    I feel like that might be a great way to guarantee that requests are synchronous and not duplicated

I dockerized the app, which meant connecting to redis via docker container name instead of localhost IP, 127.0.0.1
If you want to deploy without redis now, you'll have to change this field in cores_hub/settings.py first
